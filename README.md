# 📊 Simple Linear Regression Project (Height vs Weight)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **Simple Linear Regression** to understand the relationship between **height** and **weight**. The goal is to predict weight based on height using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## 📐 Linear Regression Formula
The regression equation used in this project:

y = β₁x + β₀

Where:
- **β₀ (Intercept):** Weight value when height is zero  
- **β₁ (Slope):** Change in weight for each unit increase in height

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Applied **Simple Linear Regression**  
- Calculated **Intercept** and **Slope**  
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - R-squared (R²)
  - Adjusted R-squared
- Calculated error metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Analyzed results using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) summary**
